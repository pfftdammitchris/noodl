Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection that usually involves fever, pain, and evidence of middle ear (behind the eardrum) inflammation with effusion (fluid). This is the most common type of ear infection. It is usually painful because parts of the middle ear are swollen and infected, and fluid is trapped behind the eardrum. Symptoms include fever and possibly puss in the ear. Infants and children with acute otitis media often pull on their ears. It can be treated with antibiotics because it's usually caused by bacteria, not a virus, although it can be a complication from a virus."

This type of ear infection is very common, and it is caused by the buildup of fluid in the middle ear. It often happens after an ear infection has run its course. Most of the time, children will not have pain, but a doctor will be able to see the fluid behind the eardrum. Otitis media with effusion usually goes away on its own, and antibiotics won't be effective. It's common to have with allergies, when exposed to irritants like cigarette smoke and in conjunction with viral upper respiratory infections."
