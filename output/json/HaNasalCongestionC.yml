Young children are more prone to infections of the nose, sinus, and ears, especially in the first several years of life. These are most frequently caused by viral infections (colds), and they may be aggravated by allergies. However, if your child remains ill beyond the usual week to ten days, a sinus infection may be the cause."

It usually affects the nose, face, sinus passages, eyes and throat. Common symptoms of hay fever include sniffling, runny nose, blocked nose, mouth breathing and sneezing. Your child might also have itchy eyes, nose, roof of the mouth and back of the throat. Your child’s eyes might be red and sore, and water a lot."

Hay fever can also lead to poor-quality sleep, tiredness and poor concentration during the daytime."
