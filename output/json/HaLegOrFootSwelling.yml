            - text: "Swelling that occurs throughout the body has different causes and may be linked to heart failure, liver failure, and kidney disorders. Pooling of blood in the legs may be a cause of swelling, however, this is more likely to occur in obese individuals and commonly resolves in the morning."

            - text: "A worrisome type of swelling is one that is confined to a single limb (Unilateral) or part of a limb commonly caused by a blood clot (Deep vein thrombosis) or a skin infection (Cellulitis). Both deep vein thrombosis and skin infections may be lead to fatality if left untreated. Blood clots may dislodge, travel to the lungs leading to blocking of the lung arteries (pulmonary embolism). Cellulitis is infectious (not contagious) and is a serious condition requiring antibiotics. If left untreated, it may lead to widespread infection which can be fatal."        
            - br: 
            - text: "Allergic reactions may cause acute swelling but typically include other parts of the body as well. It may be accompanied with trouble breathing. It is highly recommended that people with any of these warning signs see a doctor right away."        
            - br: 
            - text: "Congenital causes that block lymph Vessels(Lymphedema) is a less common cause. Previous surgeries or cancerous tumors may be a cause. If you're a tumor constricts vessels any part of the limb downstream (distally) can swell. Varicose veins are a easily diagnosable sign of changes to the veins in the legs that can be treated."
