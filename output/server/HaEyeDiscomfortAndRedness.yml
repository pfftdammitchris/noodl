Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss in people over age 40 and is the principal cause of blindness in the world. In fact, there are more cases of cataracts worldwide than there are of glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy combined, according to Prevent Blindness America (PBA). Timely cataract surgery can not only improve the visual function as early as possible, but also more importantly, it can deepen the space of the eye and effectively reduce the possibility of glaucoma development."
