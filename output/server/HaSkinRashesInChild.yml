          text: "A rash is a reaction of the skin. It can be caused by many things, such as a reaction by contact to a skin irritant, a drug reaction, an infection, or an allergic reaction. Many different agents can cause similar-appearing rashes because the skin has a limited number of possible responses. Very often the other associated symptoms or history, in addition to the rash, help establish the cause of the rash. A history of tick bites, exposure to other ill children or adults, recent antibiotic use, environmental exposures, or prior immunizations are all important elements of the patient's history to help determine the cause of a skin rash in a child."
