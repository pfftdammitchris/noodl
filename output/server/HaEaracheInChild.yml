Less commonly, the cause of the earache might be a burst eardrum because of an accident, or because a cotton bud or something similar has been pushed too far into your child’s ear."

            - text: "Your child might also have an earache because there’s an injury or infection somewhere near her ear, and she feels the pain in her ear. This could happen with sinusitis or tonsillitis, for example."
