During the first week of life, infants pass an average of 4 to 8 stools/day; breastfed infants typically have more stools than formula-fed infants. During the first few months of life, breastfed infants pass a mean of 3 stools/day, vs about 2 stools/day for formula-fed infants. By age 2 yr, the number of bowel movements has decreased to slightly < 2/day. After age 4 yr, it is slightly > 1/day."
