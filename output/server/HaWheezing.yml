It can also be caused by an obstruction in the larger airways or vocal cords. The tone of the wheeze can vary depending on which part of the respiratory system is blocked or narrowed. Narrowing in the upper respiratory system may make for a hoarser wheeze. Lower obstructions may have a more 'musical' toneWheezing is most obvious when a person is breathing out (exhaling), but can also be heard when breathing in (inhaling)."
